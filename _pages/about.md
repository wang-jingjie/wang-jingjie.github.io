## About Me

Hi! I’m a first-year PhD student in Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Brandon Pitts. I am an extroverted and enthusiastic individual who enjoys making new friends and building meaningful connections.

My academic journey has been filled with enriching experiences and accomplishments, from excelling in my undergraduate studies at Sichuan University–Pittsburgh Institute to engaging in diverse research projects spanning Cyber-Physical-Human Systems, Transportation and Emergency Management, and Human Factors. These experiences shaped my research interests and continue to motivate my pursuit of impactful and interdisciplinary work.

Beyond my academic life, I am passionate about volleyball, having served as captain of the SCUPI volleyball team, and I also enjoy singing, especially K-pop music. These activities keep me active, creative, and energized.

As I begin my PhD journey at Purdue, I am eager to expand my research horizons, collaborate with scholars across disciplines, and contribute to advancing the field of Industrial Engineering.

Feel free to connect with me if you’d like to collaborate or just chat!
