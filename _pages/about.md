## About Me

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Industrial Engineering at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute. I am an extroverted and enthusiastic individual who enjoys making new friends and connecting with others. 

My academic journey has been filled with enriching experiences and accomplishments, including high academic performance and active involvement in various projects and competitions. I have a strong interest in **Cyber-Physical-Human Systems**, **Transportation and Emergency Management**, and **Human Factors**. 

In addition to my studies, I have a passion for **volleyball**, where I serve as the captain of the SCUPI volleyball team, and **singing**, especially K-pop music. These hobbies keep me active and energized outside of my academic life.
Currently, I am preparing for my PhD application, eagerly looking forward to receiving an amazing offer and starting the next chapter of my academic and professional journey!

Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or just chat!
